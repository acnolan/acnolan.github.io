        <h3>What is a Serious Game?</h3>

        <p>The first question we need to answer, what is a <em>serious game</em>?</p>

        <p>Is it something like chess that is respected all over the world and has serious tournaments and world champions?</p>

        [picture of chess]

        <p>Is it something like eSports that are played competitively and have a lot of money involved?</p>

        [eSports picture]

        <p>Nope, neither of these. These are both examples of very unserious games.</p>

        <p>Games you can find on the childrens toy LeapPad are super serious games.</p>

        [Leappad image]

        <p>Let's explain why that is...</p>

        <p><em>Serious Games</em> is a term coined by Clark Abt in his aptly named 1970 book,  <i><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Serious_Games.html?id=axUs9HA-hF8C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serious Games</a></i>. He defines games as:</p>

        <blockquote>"Games [that] have an explicit and carefully thought-out educational purpose and are not intended to be played primarily for amusement" - Clark Abt, page 9, <i>Serious Games</i> 1970</blockquote>

        <p>However, I think that definition is a little intense, and seemingly Clark Abt did too. In the next sentence he goes on to say:</p>

        <blockquote>"This does not mean that serious games are not, or should not be, entertaining" - Clark Abt, the next sentence of page 9, <i>Serious Games</i> 1970</blockquote>

        <p>Since 1970 the field of serious games has evolved quite a bit. In Abt's original definition there is an emphasis on educational purposes. As we will see later in this blog, serious games can be any game with a non-entertaining primary purpose.</p>

        <p>A definition I really like it from the French researchers Djauti, Alvarez, and Jessel.</p>

        <blockquote>"[Serious Games] merge a non-entertaining purpose (serious) with a game structure (game)" Djauti, Alvarez, and Jessel, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266462473_Classifying_Serious_Games_the_GPS_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classifying Serious Games: the G/P/S model
        </a></blockquote>

        <p>Simply put, a serious game is a game intended for a purpose beyond education.</p>

        <h3>Important Examples</h3>

        <h4>The Leappad</h4>

        [insert image of leappad]

        <p>If you are around my age, you probably remember the Leappad. It was the top selling educational toy of 2000 and 2001 and it has had a strong legacy ever since. Cementing the Leapfrog company as one of the top purveyors in children's educational gaming.</p>

        <p>The LeapPad used books and matching cartridges to make interactive reading and phonics lessons for children. The book helped kids learn to sound out words. They also included games to reinforce the ideas leveraging their own original characters as well as popular 3rd party properties. </p>

        <p>The history and technology behind the Leappad is really cool. If you want to learn more about it I highly recommend checking out this YouTube video from ...</p>

        <h4>Kriegsspiel</h4>

        <p>Serious Games was coined in the seventies. Most of the examples we are going to talk about today are relatively modern too. But, serious games as a concept date back a long time. Kriegsspiel is a  war game that was invented by the Prussians in the 18th century. These games were used to train officers on battlefield tactics and strategies. It is considered the first modern war game.</p>

        <p>There is a long history of games used for simulating warfare. Other cultures outside 18th century Europe did this as well. 5,000 years ago in China, Wei-Hai (the Encirclement game) was invented and is considered one of the earliest war games. It later evolved into the modern game Go that we have today.</p>

        <h4>Microsoft Flight Simulator</h4>

        [Image of flight simulator]

        <p>Flight simulators can be used to train armies as well. The US Airforce even has a collection of games for training skills that they call the <a href="https://www.airforce.com/experience-the-air-force/aircade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aircade</a>.</p>

        <p>Other flight simulators originally existed as serious games. Although Microsoft Flight Simulator is now more of an entertaining game. Originally, in 1982, the first release of the Simulator was a tech demo and a true simulation. Intended to model flight, not neccissarily provide entertainment.</p>

        <h4>FoldIt</h4>

        <p>FoldIt might be the most exciting example on here. FoldIt is a protein-folding puzzle game developed by the University of Washington Bio-Chemistry department.</p>
