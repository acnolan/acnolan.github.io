        <h3>Andrew Nolan</h3>

        Benjamin Bloom strikes again! We talked about his taxonomy in a recent blog [link]. But now we will talk about his possibly even more influential paper. The two sigma problem, education's biggest unsolved mystery.

        [show two sigma graph]

        Benjamin Bloom wrote a paper called the Two Sigma problem which is perhaps one of the most famous papers in Education research.

        Interestingly, it actually started with two graduate students at the University of Chicago. There work, validated many times over in multiple experiments, showed that students all else equal, students who received 1-on-1 tutoring performed two standard deviations (2 sigma) better than students in traditional classroom settings. [Cite their paper]

        A standard deviation can be used to measure the differences from the average. In a normal distribution two standard deviations implies that the average tutored student performed better than 95% of classroom students!

        [show normal curve and standard deviation graph]

        However, the results were not normal. Tutored students in the study scored better than 98% of traditional learners. That's huge.

        Furthermore, it showed that students not only better, but faster and were more enthustiastic about learning when in 1-on-1 settings.

        Bloom calls this tutoring improvement a problem because it demonstrates that the average student is capable of great success if given the right support, but 1-on-1 tutoring for all students is not feasible in society as it is today (as it was in 1984 when the paper was written and still is 40 years later!).

        Blooms paper focuses on the search for a classroom setting two sigma solution that can parallel the results of tutoring. In 1984 they had ideas but even now 40 years later there are no solutions.

        In their search, Bloom and co found many variables that produced sizeable improvements in student learning. Individually or combined none have reached the 2x effect of tutoring though. However some strong ones include.

        <ul>
            <li>Reinforcement: 1.2x</li>
            <li>Feedback/corrections: 1x</li>
            <li>Cues and explanations: 1x</li>
            <li>Classroom participation: 1x</li>
            <li>Increased time on task: 1x</li>
            <li>Improving reading/studying skills: 1x</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From Bloom's research, all of these areas showed a single standard deviation improvement in learning outcomes. Nothing to scoff at, but these are still big tasks to implement and only perform half as well as tutoring did.</p>

        Bloom's favorite technique seems to be called "mastery learning." This technique requires students to demonstrate mastery of a topic before moving on to the next subject.

        Some solutions involved learner improvements, others were from efforts by instructors. The paper also showed studies demonstrated peer groups and home life can effect learning. Again nothing came close to the 2 sigma improvement of 1-on-1 instruction.

        The paper highlights how 1-on-1 instruction can be more effective than classroom discussion partially because of the constant back and forth nature allowing for correction and reinforcement that is slower or not available in large groups.

        Biases also exist in any group and teachers are often unaware of this and may assume their students are recieving equal access. Customized tutoring helps resolve this challenge.

        Why am I writing about this in my tech blog? I do love education topics but I have to tie it back to tech somehow...

        These solutions may provide value in the classroom setting. But now in recent times a new technology has arrived that may change the landscape without needing to change classrooms. AI may be able to level the playing field and create more accessible forms of 1-on-1 tutoring for all students.
        
        Sal Khan recently talked about how Khan Academy is working on resolving this with Khanmigo [embed youtube]. But other systems could do something as well. These AI powered learning platforms are often called intelligent learning systems. Many are leveraging the many possiblities of ChatGPT and other generative text tools for this. Khanmigo is powered by them, Duolingo pro is as well.

        Will this solve the two-sigma problem? We will see, it will be interesting to find a group setting tool that works as effectively as 1-on-1 tutoring. But AI or other tools making 1-on-1 tutrogin more accessible may also be an alternate path to solving this problem.
