        <p>It is weird to think ChatGPT hasn't even been around for half a year. When it released, it felt like a fun toy. People were doing cool things with it and getting around it's restrictions. But it seemed more like a precursor of the future. The prevailing thoughts seemed to be along the lines of "Yeah, ChatGPT is cool, but imagine what AI will be like in a few years?"</p>

        <p>But as people used it more, it's impact became more clear. ChatGPT wasn't foreshadowing changes to come, it was the changes. And people in all industries have been adapting ever since. The education space is no exception.</p>

        <p>Primary education is an oftentimes underfunded, overworked, and unfairly criticized industry. Teachers are heros and are incredibly important. But because of the challenges that they face, they are often one of the later groups to pick up on new technical trends or redefine curriculums that have been working. Especially in recent years with increased ties to state mandated testing and objectives.</p>

        <p>However, sometimes a technology comes along that sheds a light on the way things are done. ChatGPT has done this. After it's release there was a slew of fears pervading the space. Bans from large school districts across the country from New York to LA. </p>

        <p>Jenna Lyle, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Education captured this sentiment well, "While the tool may be able to provide quick and easy answers to questions, it does not build critical-­thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for academic and lifelong success."</p>
        
        <p>A machine that can write essays like a human! Cheating was in for a whole new level.</p>

        <p>As time went on, it turned out this wasn't quite true. The recent survey from the Walton Foundation that I talked about in my <a href="./ChatGPTAdoptionSurvey.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">previous blog</a> showed that cheating is low. In fact, teachers and students thought ChatGPT will improve learning! Not only that, but both groups also thought ChatGPT was shedding a light on how K-12 education needs to adapt to the changing times.</p>

        <p>Cite some stats on that last paragraph.</p>

        <p>It turns out Large Language Models, like the calculator or google or wikipedia or many technologies before it, is not hurting students. It will actually help them. The new question that researchers will be investigating is how to make that happen?</p>

        <p>A recent article by <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/author/will-douglas-heaven/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Douglas Heaven</a>, Chief AI Editor for the MIT Tech Review, titled "ChatGPT will Change not Destroy Education" discusses this topic with quotes from teachers adapting to the technology today.</p>

        <p>It feels kind of like a meta-blog to write a blog about an internet article like this, but that's what I'm planning to do! If you'd rather read the original article you can check it out <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/06/1071059/chatgpt-change-not-destroy-education-openai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Otherwise, stick around and we'll dive into it a bit!</p>
        

        



        OpenAI's statement on educators: https://platform.openai.com/docs/chatgpt-education
        -" teachers should carefully review both the inputs and outputs, and should disclose where they have used or relied on an AI system, as outlined in our Usage policies."

        If nothing else, many teachers now recognize that they have an obligation to teach their students about how this new technology works and what it can make possible. “They don’t want it to be vilified,” says Smith. “They want to be taught how to use it.”
        - Seems consistant with Walton study, educators are in favor of the tech

        We need to change how we assess learning, says Culatta: “Did ChatGPT kill assessments? They were probably already dead, and they’ve been in zombie mode for a long time. What ChatGPT did was call us out on that.”

        This idea isn’t new. Generations of teachers have subscribed to a framework known as Bloom’s taxonomy, introduced by the educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom in the 1950s, in which basic knowledge of facts is just the bedrock on which other forms of learning, such as analysis and evaluation, sit. Teachers like Donahoe and Crompton think that chatbots could help teach those other skills. 

        In the past, Donahoe would set her students to writing assignments in which they had to make an argument for something—and grade them on the text they turned in. This semester, she asked her students to use ChatGPT to generate an argument and then had them annotate it according to how effective they thought the argument was for a specific audience. Then they turned in a rewrite based on their criticism.

        Smith thinks chatbots could be the same way. If his undergraduate students want to use ChatGPT in their written assignments, he will assess the prompt as well as—or even rather than—the essay itself. “Knowing the words to use in a prompt and then understanding the output that comes back is important,” he says. “We need to teach how to do that.”

        When its US-centric response included no information about the origins of print in Europe or China, the teacher used that as the starting point for a conversation about bias. “It’s a great way to focus on media literacy,” says Stansbury.
        
        One of her favorite uses of the technology is to bring more interactivity into the classroom. Teaching methods that get students to be creative, to role-play, or to think critically lead to a deeper kind of learning than rote memorization, she says. ChatGPT can play the role of a debate opponent and generate counterarguments to a student’s positions, for example. By exposing students to an endless supply of opposing viewpoints, chatbots could help them look for weak points in their own thinking. 

        . Culatta thinks that chatbots could generate personalized material for 50 or 100 students and make bespoke tutors the norm.




        <p>I think Emily Donahoe (University of Mississippi) summarized the situation best with "This is still an ongoing experiment."</p>

        <p>This is all new and a lot of things are happening rapidly. But it should be exciting! This is a chance to try new things and hopefully improve education for the better.</p>
