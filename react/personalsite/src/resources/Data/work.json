            "The Engineering Development Group (EDG) is MathWorks's new hires program. It is a rotational program allowing participants to become embedded in project teams, work directly with customers, and complete large amounts of training.",
            "For my first project, I worked with the Online Courses team working on developing a new feature for <a href=\"https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/\" targer=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MATLAB Academy</a>. Previously, MATLAB Academy allowed users to share a shareable link with instructors to allow the tracking of course progress. Now, we have added the ability to directly share with another user by email. The instructor can then compile and download a spreadsheet file containing the progress of all of their students, improving the time it takes to grade assignments in MATLAB Academy. The front end of this project required developing several React components and widgets. The backend server code used Go and Amazon Dynamo DB. I also got to learn about the xAPI library and using Postman to test APIs.",
            "As a customer facing role, EDG members provide technical support to customers. We are the frontlines at solving issues related to MATLAB, and we provide a bridge between customer and developer for deciding on and implementing new features. The training provided software engineering training as well as technical skills with MATLAB and other MathWorks Products.",
            "I have joined several additional internal teams such as the Interview Team and the Self-Paced Training team. Through these I provide technical interviews and attend career fairs on behalf of MathWorks. Additionally, I work directly on refining and adding to our new hire training curriculum."

            "The summer of 2020 I worked remotely for MathWorks thanks to the pandemic. Despite the unfortunate event of the pandemic, my time at MathWorks was the most technically challenging and interesting software development experience I've had so far.",
            "My main project this summer involved developing code to improve the performance and reliability of saving plain code files in JavaScript versions of the MATLAB editor. Previously large files and slow networks could cause slow saves and occasional time outs and crashes. Using a combination of chunked messages and a piece table I was able to improve performance in these scenarios.",
            "This project involved a lot of research and reading of technical articles to develop the concepts used in the project. The code expanded my JavaScript knowledge, now instead of just writing simple scripts I was working with object-oriented JS. MathWorks was also the first company I worked at that included me in a truly AGILE workflow. I learned a lot about the software development life cycle and making sure documentation is good so other people can continue the work you started. As the project I worked on will be expanded and maintained in future versions of MATLAB"

            "I helped teach and grade several introductory programming Python, Racket, Java, and SQL. Beyond these intro courses, I helped teach a higher-level course on databases, this course covered the mechanisms and theory behind developing a database system, rather than how to use one, like in the intro course. Currently, I am searching for a career in software engineering. However, working as a TA is one of my best work experiences as a computer scientist. I find it very fulfilling to help someone learn new things. I can only write \"hello, world\" once, but getting to help dozens of other people write it for the first time is a good second best. Someday, I would like to return to school for a PhD and eventually work as professor."

URLs to these websites can be shared upon request. Most of my work this summer was focused on front end programming with an emphasis on responsive design. I learned about the importance of HTML metatags and search engine optimization in web design. I also did backend work using several content management systems including: Sitecore, Umbraco, Kentico Cloud, and WordPress."

            "The more time that passes since this internship the more I appreciate it. This internship occurred the summer after my freshmen year. At the time I did not know much about large scale software development or working at a company. However, the internship challenged me and allowed me to write actual impactful code and learn a ton while doing it. Looking back, I learned so much during my time here that has helped me in my CS journey since then.",
            "The NMS IT internship is interesting as it was broken into 3 parts: Systems/Networks, Development, and Quality Assurance. As a programmer, I spent most of my summer with the development group. However, I got to spend two weeks with both QA and Networks. With the networks group I learned a lot about setting up hardware, I spent a day imaging several machines (not super exciting). I went on several help calls to do things such as connecting a wireless printer to an employee's laptop or setting up a projector in a conference room for a company meeting. With QA, I got my first experience in testing code. I performed a checklist of manual unit tests to test a graphical user interface.",
            "During the main portion of the summer, I assisted the developers in creating a new web application to serve as a virtual marketplace for NMS's clients. I mostly performed minor bug and CSS fixes. But I learned CSS, HTML, and JavaScript as well as backend web development in C# using Microsoft's .NET MVC Framework. Additionally, I had more core coding responsibility when my mentor took 2 weeks off when his wife had a baby. I took over finishing development of an internal intranet web app to be used by the NMS Marketing team to handle inventory management, also in the ASP.NET MVC framework. I learned and wrote several PL/SQL procedures to be called by the C# backend. This was my first introduction to SQL and taught me a lot about data bases that I wouldn't learn in school until much later."
