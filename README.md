Welcome to the repository for my personal website!

Mostly it is used for providing some more details and context beyond what fits on a resume. 

In the future I hope to host personal projects and blogs as well!

As a personal project, I did remake the app in React, check it out [here](https://personal-site-10a4b.web.app/) (hosted on Firebase).
